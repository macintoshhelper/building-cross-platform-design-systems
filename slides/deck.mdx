# Quotes

“React is such a good idea that we will spend the rest of the decade continuing to explore its implications and applications.”

Guillermo Rauch – founder of Vercel (ZEIT)

“Here’s the simple truth: you can’t innovate on products without first innovating the way you build them.”

Alex Schleifer – VP of Design at Airbnb

# What is React?

JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Where UI is a function of state.

```js
UI = fn(state);
```

- Declarative
  - function that takes your application state and renders an interactive UI.
- Component-Based
  - Should apply to design too
- Learn Once, Write Anywhere
  - Cross-platform (with some work)

# React Renderer

```js
type createElement = (type, props, children) => ReactElement;
```

```js
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
```

# `react-dom`

```js
const App = () => (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello World</h1>
  </div>
  <main>
    <div
      onClick={() => alert('Hello World!')}
      style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'green' }}
    />
    <HomePageContent />
  </main>
);

const appRawJson = {
  "type": "div",
  "props": {
    "children": [{

      "props": {
        "children": ["Hello World"]

# `react-native`

```js
const App = () => (
  <View>
    <Text>Hello World</Text>
  </View>
  <View>
    <Touchable onPress={() => alert('Hello World!')}>
      <View style={{ flex: 1, backgroundColor: 'green' }}/>
    </Touchable>
    <HomePageContent />
  </View>
);

const appRawJson = {
  "type": "view",
  "props": {
    "children": [{
      "type": "text",
      // Should be something like "native_text",
      // since it's an internal/private API
      "props": {
        "children": ["Hello World"]
      }
    }]

# React Reconciler

Go to code

# Platforms

Apps traditionally target specific platforms.

<Steps>

- Web – HTML / CSS –> `react-dom`
- iOS – Objective-C / Swift -> `react-native`
- Android – Java / Kotlin -> `react-native`
- Mac – Objective-C / Swift -> `react-native-macos`
- Windows – C# -> `react-native-windows`
- Linux – C++ / QT -> `react-native-desktop-qt`

</Steps>

</Container>

<Notes>
  You need to either choose a specific platform and focus on that, or build your app multiple times for it to work across different platforms.

  e.g. web and react-native

# `react-primitives`

Primitive React Interfaces Across Targets.

Exposes a common API across many React platforms, that lets you build your UI once and render it to any platform.

Great for design systems and component libraries.

# `react-sketchapp`

<Container>

React Sketch.app is an open-source library that allows you to write React components that render to Sketch documents.

<Steps>

- Currently built with `react-test-renderer` (no runtime)
- Build components with `react-primitives`
- Render them to Sketch
- Generate design assets/library to hand over to a designer
- Svg support – (d3.js)

</Steps>

# `react-figma`

React Figma is an open-source library that allows you to write React components that render to Figma documents.

<Steps>

- Built with `react-reconciler` (access to runtime events)

</Steps>

# Lona

A tool for defining design systems and using them to generate cross-platform UI code, Sketch files, and other artifacts.

<Notes>
  Generates native code, i.e. Swift, Kotlin, React, React Native, React Sketch.app, etc. Not React specific.
